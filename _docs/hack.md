Nuclide has been built from the start to provide a great IDE experience for Hack development. If
you have Hack installed on your local system or on a server, and open a project with Nuclide, 
you'll get support for click-to-define (`cmd-click`) type-hinting:

Inline error highlighting and diagnostics:

Inline autocomplete for Hack and PHP:

And an omni-search bar that'll find anything in your project (`cmd-t`):
